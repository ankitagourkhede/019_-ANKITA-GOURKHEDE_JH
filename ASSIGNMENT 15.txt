SELECT *
FROM multicust;

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

DELETE customers
WHERE cnum=ANY
    (SELECT cnum
     FROM orders
     WHERE cnum NOT IN
         (SELECT cnum
          FROM customers));

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

SELECT * FROM salespeople;
UPDATE salespeople

    (SELECT snum
     FROM orders
     WHERE amt>300);
SELECT * FROM salespeople;
