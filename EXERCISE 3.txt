                                  EXERCISE 3

1) Display all the Supplier names with the initial letter capital.

     SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(SNAME,1,1)),LOWER(SUBSTRING     (SNAME,2))) AS SNAME FROM S;

2) Display all the Supplier names in upper case.

     SELECT UPPER (SNAME)
      FROM S;

3) Display all the Supplier names in lower case.

   SELECT LOWER (SNAME)
   FROM S;

4) Display all the Supplier names padded to 25 characters, with spaces on the left.
  
   SELECT LPAD (SNAME,25,'  ')
   FROM S;
 
  5)  Display all the Supplier names (with ‘la’ replaced by ‘ro’).  HINT: REPLACE.
    
    UPDATE S
    SET SNAME = REPLACE(SNAME, 'la', 'ro') 
    WHERE SNAME LIKE '%la%';

  6)  Implement the above command such that ‘l’ is replaced with ‘r’ and ‘a’ is replaced with ‘o’.

     SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(SNAME,'l','r'),'a','o')
     AS "SNAME" FROM S;
      
    
7) Display the Supplier names and the lengths of the names.

     SELECT SNAME, LENGTH(SNAME) 'Length of Names' 
    FROM S;

8) Use the soundex function to search for a supplier by the name of ‘BLOKE’.
     SELECT * FROM S 
     WHERE SOUNDEX(SNAME) = SOUNDEX('BLOKE');
