     above-average orders.
     SELECT cname,  rating
    FROM customers
    WHERE cnum IN
    (SELECT cnum
     FROM orders
     WHERE amt >
         (SELECT avg(amt)
          FROM orders));

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
     whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
     SELECT sum(amt)
     FROM orders
    GROUP BY snum
    HAVING sum(amt)>
    (SELECT max(amt)
