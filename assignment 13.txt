                                              assignment 13

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all     customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High      Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

    SELECT cname, city, HIGH RATING' RATING
    FROM customers
    WHERE rating>200
           UNION
    SELECT cname, city, 'LOW RATING' RATING
    FROM customers
    WHERE rating <=200;

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.

SELECT sname, snum, cname
FROM salespeople
JOIN customers using(snum)
WHERE snum IN
    (SELECT snum
     FROM customers
     GROUP BY snum
     HAVING count(snum)>1)
ORDER BY sname,cname;

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
 (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)

SELECT snum
FROM salespeople
WHERE city='san jose'
         UNION
SELECT DISTINCT snum
FROM orders
WHERE snum IN
    (SELECT snum
     FROM orders
     WHERE odate LIKE '03-10-%');
