1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the Orders table quickly.

CREATE INDEX d_order ON orders(odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to be unique (assume all current values are unique)?

DESCRIBE orders;
ALTER TABLE orders MODIFY onum CONSTRAINT  o_pk PRIMARY KEY;
 DESCRIBE orders;

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders grouped by date quickly.

CREATE INDEX I_DATE ON orders(odate);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

ALTER TABLE customers MODIFY rating PRIMARY KEY;
